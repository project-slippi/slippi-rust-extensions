//! This module houses the `SlippiEXIDevice`, which is in effect a "shadow subclass" of the C++
//! Slippi EXI device.
//!
//! What this means is that the Slippi EXI Device (C++) holds a pointer to the Rust
//! `SlippiEXIDevice` and forwards calls over the C FFI. This has a fairly clean mapping to "when
//! Slippi stuff is happening" and enables us to let the Rust side live in its own world.
